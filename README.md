# Neo4j
## How to test
First clone the repo : ```git clone https://github.com/17341/Neo4j```

Make sure to have Node Js install on your machine.

Then go to the repo directory and run :  ```npm install```

Go to ./src/utils/Credentials.json and change it to yours if you want or you can leave it as it is to work on our cloud db. (If the page is loading infinitly or you have no results, verify the credentials or try using a vpn)

Finally after that all the node nodules are installed run the program using : ```npm start ```

Note : The tests were made on google chrome on a computer.
